The data was manipulated in the format of a csv file and the required contents and other techniques were implemented 
on it using Pandas.

The model was built as a tensorflow computational graph using Linear regession and after training and testing the model on the 
manipulated dataset, It was able to execute successfully with an accuracy of 99%.
